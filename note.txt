1.   at the time of dployment if there is any warnning or error regarding the non-serialized values or functions 
    
     (it is error due to pass the callback setShowTask and setSelecetedTask at the screen directly )
   
   solution : - 
               
               use context api at tab navigation and do not pass the callback directly to the tabs ALLtask FinishedTAsk and pending setShowTask
